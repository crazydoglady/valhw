      <h1>Valerie K. Harvey</h1>
      <p><h2>Hi!</h2></p>
      <p>Currently, Mount Pleasant, SC is home. I was raised in the South, Midwest, and even spent a few years in the Northeast before migrating to a warmer, coastal climate. </p>
      <p>I earned my BA from University of Wisconsin-Madison with a double major in Political Science and Russian Language. The Cold War had long ended by the time I graduated, and I found myself in the Chicago suburbs working in recruiting. I pursued a career in Human Resources and earned my PHR certification in 2009. Fast forward several years (and a few moves across the country) and I really wanted to incorporate a little creativity into my professional endeavors. This led me to try a few Web Basics courses and I was hooked! Ultimately, with much encouragement and support from my family and friends I enrolled at The Iron Yard, where I am working towards a second career in web development.</p>
      <p>When I'm not working or learning, I have a wide range of hobbies that include trivia, visual arts, cooking, and running the occasional half marathon.</p>
      <p><h2>Meet the hounds...</h2></p>
      <p>If you have spent any amount of time talking to me, you have probably heard about my dogs, so it would be unthinkable to leave them out of this section of my website! They are my pets, friends, and frequent copilots. Ember and Billie love a good adventure (or anything involving a car ride), so I take them with me everywhere I can.</p>

        <p><h2>Ember </h2>was my first greyhound, adopted through <a href="https://www.ngap.org/index.html">NGAP</a>  2011 while living in Philadelphia. Her race name was "Astarroyalheaven" and was retired after only 9 races,  but we don't tell the neighborhood rabbits that she is slow. Ember's retirement includes work as a registered <a href="https://www.therapydogs.com/Public/Home.aspx">Therapy Dog</a>, visiting medical and assisted living facilities to visit with patients and residents. She will do almost anything for baby carrots and string cheese.</p>

        <p><h2>Billie</h2>joined the pack in 2013 after our move to Charleston. She raced under the name "Hallo Mrs Leen" and ran 113 races before she was injured on the track and forced into retirement. Fortunately for us, she was patched up and later adopted through <a href="http://www.adoptcharlestongreys.org/">GPA-Charleston</a>. Billie still loves to run and has made her own track in the backyard around the firepit. Billie is an expert-level couch hog and countersurfer.</p>
